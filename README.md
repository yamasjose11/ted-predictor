# Introduction

# Motivation and Objective

My motivation for this project is woven in my underlying passion for learning and Ted Talks never fail to teach me something new. I want to explore what exactly makes a show worth getting more views than the next. That is exactly what I wanted to do when choosing this project. I will be trying to use classification to help me in doing so and in this case a binary classification. 

# The Problem

# The Approach 

# The Results and Insights

# Future Development

For future development I strongly believe continuing down the path of further investigating the feature importances can continue to help me improve my model by increasing recall in both classes. I would also like to build a Flask App where it can use an API call for the most recent Ted Talk and predict if the ted talk will be more favorable than its counterparts.
